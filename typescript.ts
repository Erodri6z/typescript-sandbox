// let food: string = 'Popcorn'

// defining it as a string as seen above is something that is only really needed if you will try to declare it again.
// Its always best to over define the types and not let it infer.

//one of the big places typescript shines is in catching errors.

// let myMeal = true

// myMeal.push('beef')

// ^^ notice the linting

// remember that TypeScript only matters when in development. Once we are done it will be transcribed/compiled into regular JavaScript

// Keep in mind, you cannot write typescript in node

let myTSFood = 'twizzlers'
